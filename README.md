# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
$pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Put files in root directory and change filepath in `server_data_informer.py` if needed
```bash
$python3 server_data_informer.py
```
